    "Http protocol is the foundation of data communication in world wide web. Different methods of data retrieval from specified URL are defined in this protocol. Following are the two most used methods:\n",
    "1. **GET**\n",
    "    Sends data in unencrypted form to the server. Most common method.\n",
    "2. **POST**\n",
    "    Used to send HTML form data to server.\n",
    "    \n",
    "By default, the Flask route responds to the GET requests. However, this preference can be altered by providing methods argument to ``route()``.\n",

    "### Flask – Sending Form Data to Template\n",
    "Lets create an html file **marks.html** containing a Form which allows user to enter marks of this course:\n",
    "```\n",
    "<html>\n",
    "   <body>\n",
    "      <form action = {{url_for('submitform')}} method=\"post\">\n",
    "         <p>Name <input type = \"text\" name = \"Name\" /></p>\n",
    "         <p>Application Development <input type = \"text\" name = \"appdev\" /></p>\n",
    "         <p><input type = \"submit\" value = \"submit\" /></p>\n",
    "      </form>\n",
    "   </body>\n",
    "</html>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Form data is POSTed to the URL in action attribute of form tag.\n",
    "Next, write a function ``submitform`` in your PythonScript as:\n",
    "```\n",
    "@app.route('/submitform/',methods=['post'])\n",
    "def submitform():\n",
    "\tresult = request.form\n",
    "\treturn render_template('result.html',result=result)\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "In the above code, we specify \"Post\" method in the route. \n",
    "#### Flask Request Object\n",
    "In the client-server architecture, the **request** object contains all the data that is sent from the client to the server. As we have already discussed in the tutorial, we can retrieve the data at the server side using the HTTP methods.\n",
    "In order to process the request data, it should be **imported from the Flask module**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important attributes of request object are listed below − **\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Form − It is a dictionary object containing key and value pairs of form parameters and their values.\n",

    "\n",
    "3. files − data pertaining to uploaded file.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. method − current request method.\n",

    "```\n",
    "<!doctype html>\n",
    "<html>\n",

    "   </body>\n",
    "</html>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Embedding Python statements in HTML\n",
    "Due to the fact that HTML is a mark-up language and purely used for the designing purpose, sometimes, in the web applications, we may need to execute the statements for the general-purpose computations. For this purpose, Flask facilitates us the delimiter {%...%} which can be used to embed the simple python statements into the HTML.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Template part of result.html employs a **for loop** to render key and value pairs of dictionary object result{} as cells of an HTML table. The statement for for-loop statement is enclosed inside {%...%} delimiter, whereas, the key variable and the value is enclosed inside {{ ... }} placeholders.\n",
    "\n",
    "For conditions, if statements can be used inside HTML code. Make sure to use ``endif`` to end the block of if condition. Below is the code snippet:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "<!doctype html>\n",
    "<html>\n",
    "   <body>\n",
    "      <table border = 1>\n",
    "         {% for key, value in result.items() %}\n",
    "            <tr>\n",
    "\t\t\t{% if value|int > 60 and key == \"appdev\" %}\n",
    "\t\t\t\t<h1>Congratulations you are pass</h1>\n",
    "\t\t\t{% endif %}\n",
    "               <th> {{ key }} </th>\n",

    "\n",
    "Since we are using the development server on the same device, hence the file will be uploaded to the directory from where the flask script  is executed.:\n",
    "\n",
    "Add the following code in your Python script\n",
